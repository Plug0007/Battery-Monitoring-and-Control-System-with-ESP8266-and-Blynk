# Battery-Monitoring-and-Control-System-with-ESP8266-and-Blynk
This project demonstrates how to monitor battery health, battery percentage, voltage, and current using an ESP8266, an ASC712 current sensor, and a voltage divider. It also integrates the Blynk app for real-time monitoring and control of a relay based on system conditions.
